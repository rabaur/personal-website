RLHF has the potential to transform the way we interact with RL agents. However, the current state of the art in RLHF is limited by the lack of a unified and configurable interface for human feedback. To address this, we present RLHF-Blender, a configurable interactive interface for learning from diverse human feedback. RLHF-Blender is designed to be a flexible and extensible platform that can be easily adapted to different RLHF scenarios.
