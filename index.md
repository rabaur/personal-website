I am pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science at ETH Zurich, supported by the prestigious [ETH AI Center Doctoral Fellowship](https://ai.ethz.ch/about-us/people/doctoral-students.html). My research is supervised by [Prof. Dr. Mennatallah El-Assady](https://ivia.ch) and [Prof. Dr. Christoph HÃ¶lscher](https://cog.ethz.ch/people/christoph-hoelscher.html).

Previously, I completed my Master's degree and Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at ETH Zurich, focusing on **AI** and **architectural design**.

I am interested to use human-AI collaboration to integrate human expertise and creativity into complex design processes, in particular in the field of **hospital designs**.
