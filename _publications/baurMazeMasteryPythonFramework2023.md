MazeMastery is a Python framework for teaching maze traversal to high school students. It helps students develop abstraction skills by providing a didactic tool. They can test their algorithms against randomized test cases of increasing complexity. The framework facilitates learning analysis and conceptual challenges. MazeMastery is an open-source project for scientists and educators.
