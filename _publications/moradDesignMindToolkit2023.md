Integrating empirical evidence into architectural design has the potential to create more humane, legible, and inclusive spaces. Yet, the fast-paced nature of the design process, limited proficiency in scientific terminology, and a natural reliance on design intuition limit architects' ability to effectively apply empirical findings to inform their design decisions. To address this gap, this paper presents DesignMind, a toolkit for evidence-based, cognitively-informed, and human-centred architectural design. DesignMind has four complementary modules: (1) evidence-based design flashcards, (2) topological and geometric analysis, (3) agent-based simulation, and (4) cognitive walkthrough in virtual reality.
