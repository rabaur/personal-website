I am a Master Student in Computer Science, with a major in Machine Intelligence.
I am currently working as a research assistant at the [IVIA Lab](https://ivia.ethz.ch/), lead by Menna El-Assady, and the [Chair of Cognitive Science](https://cog.ethz.ch/), lead by Christoph HÃ¶lscher.

My research focuses on the intersection of **AI**, **architectural design**, and **cognition**. My goal is to design systems that augment human creativity and decision-making in architectural design to shape the built environment of the future.
